# PeaKBench

Benchmarking is an essential aspect of any database management system effort. With the study of new 
applications having critical transaction processing requirements, we see an explosion of designing 
innovative scalable databases or new processing architecture on traditional databases dealing with 
high intensive transaction workloads. These new applications have obvious characteristics of sharp 
dynamics, terrific skewness, and high concurrence, which are called SecKill and can saturate the 
traditional database systems by high workloads and intensive contention. Due to the lack of such 
an application-oriented benchmark simulating the real workloads, it results in lots of unnecessary 
engineering efforts and makes the performance evaluation difficult to compare. To remedy this problem 
and assist database selection we present PeakBench, a SecKill-oriented transactional processing (OLTP) benchmark.
